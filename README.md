# CARVI Quests

**CARVI Quests** is an open-source, project-based technical assessment framework built around a simple yet engaging LLM-driven RPG game.

It is designed to evaluate real-world engineering skills through hands-on work, realistic constraints, and incremental problem-solving — not through artificial puzzles or disconnected coding challenges.

The project is used internally at **Groupe CARVI** as part of our technical hiring process and evolves over time through candidate contributions.
