# CARVI Quests

**CARVI Quests** is an open-source simple yet engaging LLM-driven RPG game.

Its primary use is as a project-based technical assessment framework designed to evaluate real-world engineering skills through hands-on work, realistic constraints, and incremental problem-solving — not through artificial puzzles or disconnected coding challenges.

You can find detailed information about the assessment philosophy, flow, and technical stack in the [ASSESSMENT.md](ASSESSMENT.md) file.
